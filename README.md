## Overview of Analysis
Previously, we determined that Oahu is an ideal location for our new surf shop by analyzing a full year's worth of precipitation data. However, W. Avy has now asked us to examine temperature trends across 2010-2017 to further solidify our conclusion. Specifically, for each year in the previously mentioned range, we'll examine the temperature data from the months of June and December. 

## Results
* Despte being sixth months apart, the average temperatures for the months of June and December are only 3°F apart!
* The maximum temperature for the month of December is 83°F. Thus, during a month which one may reasonably expect to be consistenly cold, December still holds at least a few quality-weather surf days.
* Expanding further on our previous point, by examining the Standard Deviation for the month of December, we can conclude that a majority of our temperatures lie close to our mean of 71°F. Thus, not only does December hold "at least a few" quality-weather surf days, but rather, December holds plenty of quality-weather surf days.

## Summary
In summary, despite being sixth months apart, the months of June and December in Oahu both provide plenty of quality-weather surf days. Therefore, the surf and ice cream shop will be sustainable year-round. However, listed below are two additional queries we could perform to continue our analysis:

1. Determine how rapidly temperatures in Oahu are increasing or decreasing from year to year. For instance, we could compare the average temperature from each month, for each year in our dataset and plot the results as they change over time.
2. Similarly, from year to year, examine the standard deviations of the temperatures to determine if temperatures in Oahu are staying consistent or starting to vary more and more.
